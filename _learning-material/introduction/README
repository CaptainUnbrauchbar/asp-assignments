The instructions given in the following are meant to provide a roadmap for a
hands-on introduction to the ASP system clingo <https://potassco.org/clingo/>.

The clingo system is available on Linux machines in the computer pool room
03.04.0.03-0.04 of the Institute for Informatics/Computational Science, under
this filename:

  /home/flaferriere/PUBLIC/clingo

Note that clingo is command-line based and invoked in a shell, where we below
assume that bash is used. To see whether clingo is ready to run, please try
invoking this command in the shell:

  /home/flaferriere/PUBLIC/clingo --version

If you see version information output by clingo, you are basically ready to
start, yet it may be convenient to launch clingo without typing the full path
all the time. To this end, consider setting up your PATH environment variable
as follows:

  export PATH=$PATH:/home/flaferriere/PUBLIC/

You may also insert this line into some configuration file that is loaded each
time a shell is opened, e.g., the

  ~/.profile

file. If needed, you can (re)load such a file within a shell with the command:

  source ~/.profile

When you are set up to run clingo, take a look at the logic program files from
this archive in the following order:

(1) See the facts and comments in the (instance) file triangle.lp.
(2) Open the (encoding) file color.lp and follow the TODO items in comments.
(3) Open the (encoding) file cycle.lp and follow the TODO items in comments.
(4) Open the (encoding) file latin.lp and follow the TODO items in comments.

It is also worthwhile to take a look at the Basic Modeling slides
<http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~torsten/Potassco/Slides/modeling.pdf> that
provide additional information and illustration of modeling problems in ASP.
